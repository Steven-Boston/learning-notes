# Duckett Javascript: Expressions, Operators, and Functions 
## Pages 1-24
Javascript makes webpages more interactive. It has several primary uses:
- Accesing content
- Modifying content
- Programming rules
- Reacting to events
Javascript programming consists primarily of scripts- sets of insrtuctions to be followed by the browser
In order to write a script, you must first state and understand your goal, then map out the steps (tasks) needed to reach it. 
These tasks have to be communicated to the computer through code, using vocabulary and syntax the computer understands. 

## Pages 74-79
**Expressions** take a value and assign it to a variable. They can do this either by defining the value straight out or combining multiple items to synthesize it. 
Expressions achieve this via **operators**, which come in several types:
- Assignment Operators directly assign a value (`color = 'blue';`)
- Comparison Operators compare values and return a boolean (`acquire = 4>3;`)
- Arithmetic Operators perform calculations (`manaValue = 3 + 2;`)
- Logical Operators Combine expressions to return a boolean (`cast = (4>3) && (5>4);`)
- String Operators combine strings (`priority = 'in ' + 'response';`)

Arithmetic has several functions available:
- Addition + and Subtraction -
- Multiplication * and Division / 
- Increment ++ and Decrement --
- Modulus % (divides values and returns remainder)
These operations folloe standard order of operations. 

## Pages 88-94
**Functions** are predefined operations that you can code and then call upon many times. they generally require **parameters** and then produce a **Return Value**.
A function can be declared in the form 
`function functionName() {}` 
and then called later with simply `functionName()`, making performing the function's operations many times much simpler.
If information is needed, the function can be declared as `function functionName(info1, info2) {}` and then use the collected variables in its operations. 
You can then let the returned value be stored in a variable or array.
