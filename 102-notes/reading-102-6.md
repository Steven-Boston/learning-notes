# 6a: JavaScript: Writing Scripts for Webpages

JavaScript enables the developer to add behaviours to their webpage, and should be coded in a separate file that is linked from the html file. 

`object.method(parameter)` is the base form of calling a javascript function. browsers will execute scripts found in html wherever they are linked in the html file. 

# 6b: How Computers Work
### What is a Computer?]
A computer has four basic functions:
- Input
- Storage
- Processing
- Output
The computer takes any sort of input, store it, process it, store it again, then output it. these things all come in many forms. 
### Data and Binary
electrical circuits can be on or off, equating to one or zero. using multiple (many!) of these circiuts, a computer can represent anything. 
### Circuits and Logic
By combining circuits to give comparative output, many circuits can combine to create huge calculations. smaller circuits can execute these calculations faster, and thereby modern circuits can handle huge numbers of calculations in virtually no time. 
### Memory, CPU, Input, Output
Each of a computer's functions is done by a specific set of components. Input devices turn input into binary code, memory stores that code, the CPU processes the data, and output devices use the processed data to do or show the result.
### Hardware and Software
Programs give a set of guidelines as to how inputs should be processed. The CPU handles operations as governed by the Operating system, thereby allowing the computer to handle many programs simultaneously.
