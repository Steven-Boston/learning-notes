Code Blocks: 
  When presenting code, a single backtick on either end lets you present it `message = 'without breaking stride'`. Four spaces give you more space to work with:
   message = "This can let you present multiple lines of code"
   print(message)
Alternatively, you can also use triple backticks on each end to create a fence for a code block with a similar result.
