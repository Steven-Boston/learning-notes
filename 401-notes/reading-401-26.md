## C# Corner: The Basics of MVC
This article is available [here](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/learn-basics-of-mvc-architecture/).

This helpful article explains the architecture used to obey the idiosyncracies of MVC, which mostly amounts to keeping in mind that finding a view requires you to reference the controller it is hidden away in, followed by the action that you would like the controller to form. Hopefully that action eventually leads to a view of the same name. If you keep the file and folder naming lined up, MVC will do the rest. Very useful for putting code in your HTML without it becoming hideous. 

## Microsoft Docs: Tag Helpers
This documentation is available [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/tag-helpers/intro?view=aspnetcore-2.1).

Speaking of putting code in your HTML, tag helpers let you just do that at the simultaneous touch of the shift and 2 buttons. Write some logic into the impenetrable darkness of html, summon vicious models to your aid from your MVC actions, and read the names of your victims from their cookies. The power is yours for the painstaking. 

## Bootstrap Documentation
