## Microsoft Docs: Data Tutorial
This article is available [here]().

This tutorial is a breakdown of how to build a complex data model with .NET, incorporating relational database structure and many categories of information. This requires the use of `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations`, as well as an interlocking system of IDs that allow each table to point to others. 

Each table (which contains some subset of the breadth of the database's information) needs its own class file that outlines the types of data and how they are arranged. Some will exist solely to manage connections between others, and some are simply lists to be referenced.

## TutorialsPoint: Datbase Management Systems
This article is available [here]().

This tutorial discusses the various parameters of DataBase Management Systems. In the past, data was stored in ways that were both inefficient and frustratingly opaque, and as a result a number of common ideas exist surrending the handling of data. These include consistency and clarity, close modeling of real-world ideas, use of tables and relational indicators, adherence to query language for ease of access and more. The result is a modern society with a greatly improved status of data handling.
