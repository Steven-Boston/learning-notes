# Reading 401-10: Stacks and Queues

Stacks and Queues are similar in structure to the LinkedLists we have been working on over the last week, but the flow and usage of the nodes differs: 

- In a Stack, the Stack object is connected to the top of a vertical stack. That top node is both the entry point and exit point for add nodes, and each one is connected to that top Node in a linked list. 

- Stack Methods:
    * Push
    * Pop
    * Peek
    * IsEmpty


- In a queue on the other hand, there is an additional connection in the Queue object that stores the back of the list. Nodes enter the list from the back, and exit from the front. 

- Queue Methods:
    * EnQueue
    * DeQueue
    * Peek
    * IsEmpty
