# Reading 401-15: Trees

## CodeFellows: Trees
This curriculum document is available [here]().

A tree is a data structure composed of nodes that branch from a root that is stored as a property of the data structre. Each node has multiple node references rather than simply a .Next, most commonly a right and left (which forms a binary tree), making them "leaves" of the tree. Trees are useful for sorting data as well as for handling branching scenarios, and can represent a variety of ideas. 

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a common type of tree structure that takes a dataset and then sorts it according to some criteria (perhaps smallest to largest), storing the lesser values to left leaves and greater to the right. This results in a tree that can be easily restored to its order or searched with great efficiency. 

There are several methods of traversing a binary tree, which can be subdivided into depth-first and breadth-first traversals. Most methods of tree traversal involve using recursion to consider which path to take one node at a time, calling the method until the desired result has been achieved.
