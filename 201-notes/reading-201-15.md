# Reading 201-15 (14b): Google's Teambuilding Quest
This article by Charles Duhigg is available [here.](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html)

This article chronicles Google's quest to optimize efficiency in teams by relentlessly observing trends in how the teams operated. Everything from background to aptitude to experience was examined at every intersection. What they found, however, was that the team's dynamics in their interactions, their overall group culture, were the core of whether they were successful. 

At the core of these dynamics lay psycological safety: the group's tendency toward egalitarian conversation and social sensitivity. Working to establish these in a team dynamic can be difficult, and often involves working on the problem at the core of the team. 

What this research has revealed is actually quite straighforward: these little suppressions, small conflicts, and draining commitments to maintaining a certain 'appearance' in work environments can be the key to performing and feeling better in the workplace.
