## Designing a Website

#### Objectives
When creating a website, the question of audience must drive each decision. Every demographic data point is in play. 

Next, the question of purpose: why do people use your site? Entertainment? Information? Shopping? These core elements of purpose can be broken down into motivations and goals. 

Based on those goals, you can assess the information your visitors will need and begin incorporating it into how you plan your website. Each item or feature you add should tie into these core goals

How often will people visit your site? What does this mean for the need for updates? 

#### Structure
Once you have assessed what your site will need to do, you are able to construct a site map that outlines the pages you will need and what each section of each page will accomplish. 

Sketch out a wireframe for each page on your site that delineates where the critical items on each page will be located and how much space will be allocated to them. 

#### Visual Design
Use visual hierarchy and and visual distinction to control where focus is placed in your webpage so that the most important information is always observed. Organize pages in a logical fashion to make it easier for users to parse information. 
- Size, color, and style can all be used to create visual hierarchy. 
- Visually grouping similar items can help the user understand which items are related.
- Navigation should be kept short and concise for clarity.
