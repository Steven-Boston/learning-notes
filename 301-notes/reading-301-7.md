# Reading 301-7: REST
This article can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

This article, written as a transcript of a dialogue, is part history and part concept monologue outlining the importance of HTTP, the rise of (and continuing value of the expansion of) APIs and other forms of internet resources designed to be accessed by machines. 

The author explains the situation at large to his brother, who is presented as being a layperson. He compares the use of various web resources and the actions that manipulate them to the combining of verbs to nouns in the english language. He extends the use of this metaphor by explaining that the main problem we face in unlocking the next stage of computer science is the ability for machines to make these combinations more freely.
