Node.js is a runtime engine for javascript. Whatever that means. It is built with the V8 JavaScript engine that is used by most modern web browsers, which seems like a good idea. The article provides some mild detail on these concepts and then provides some instructions for getting started and installing Node.js. 

Once we choose to accept the above jargon and get everything installed, we can begin with the business of using node's build tools to automate the development of Javascript? Boy are we flying quickly over some rather large concerns. To alleviate these, the article offers a flurry of further reading. 

Moving along, the article points out that we can use node to run javascript on the server, the first thing it has mentioned that lies at the intersection of comprehensible and practical. The article also explains that the node framework reorganizes the paths that your app takes when interacting with the server, and by doing so makes those operations more efficient and responsive. All these interactions are event-based, which makes node.js ideal for creating apps that require constant and speedy user interaction.

This article outlines six reasons for pair programming: 

- Greater Efficiency
- Engaged Collaboration
- Learning from others
- Social skills
- Job interview readiness
- Work environment readiness

Pair programming has been a valuable tool each time we have used it to complete lab work so far, and I expect it will continue to prove so as we move forward.
