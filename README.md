An elegant repository for a more civilized age

Learning in any arena requires a **growth mindset**. This means being open to new ideas, challenges, and most of all, failure and growth. To maintain this focus, I will have to keep several tenets in mind:

- Learn from my peers at *every* opportunity.
- Use obstacles as a fulcrum for improvement.
- Remember that everyone is on their own journey, and progresses at their own pace. 

>"The most important step a man can take. It's not the first one, is it?<br/>"It's the *next* one. Always the next step, Dalinar." -Brandon Sanderson's *Oathbringer*
